# 3D-World-THREE-js
This is 3d world simulation using THREE JS weglrenderer which reders a 3d scene on your canvas.
Here I have used OrbitControl.js for giving controls to camera.
Basically Its a UV Mapping in interior of an Spherical mesh With camera at the center.
You can control the camera using mouse cursor and can rotate the camera in the scene.
